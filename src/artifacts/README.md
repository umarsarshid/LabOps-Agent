# src/artifacts

`src/artifacts/` owns output files generated by runs and triage.

## Why this folder exists

The project promise is a clean, reproducible evidence packet. This module ensures every run emits a predictable bundle layout and file contracts.

## Expected outputs

- `scenario.json` snapshot of the exact scenario that was run.
- `run.json` for run metadata.
- `events.jsonl` append-only run timeline.
- `metrics.csv` for plotting and spreadsheet workflows.
- `metrics.json` for machine parsing by agent logic.
- `bundle_manifest.json` listing artifact files, sizes, and hashes.
- optional `<run_id>.zip` support bundle archive.
- Diff/report files against baseline.
- Structured bundle directories (`<out>/<run_id>/`) ready to share with
  engineers.

## Current contents

- `run_writer.hpp/.cpp`: writes canonical `run.json` files into an output
  directory and ensures directory creation.
- `metrics_writer.hpp/.cpp`: writes canonical metrics artifacts:
  - `metrics.csv` for plotting and spreadsheet workflows
  - `metrics.json` for machine parsing by agent logic
- `scenario_writer.hpp/.cpp`: copies source scenario into bundle as
  `scenario.json` for reproducibility.
- `bundle_manifest_writer.hpp/.cpp`: writes `bundle_manifest.json` with
  per-file `size_bytes` and `fnv1a_64` hash values.
- `bundle_zip_writer.hpp/.cpp`: writes optional support zip archives
  (`<out>/<run_id>.zip`) for bundle handoff.
- `metrics_diff_writer.hpp/.cpp`: compares baseline/run `metrics.csv` summary
  rows and writes:
  - `diff.json` for machine parsing
  - `diff.md` for human triage review

## Design principle

Artifact structure should be stable and easy to parse by both humans and automation.

## Connection to the project

Without reliable artifact contracts, isolated findings cannot be handed off efficiently. This folder is the bridge between test execution and actionable engineering evidence.
