# src/artifacts

`src/artifacts/` owns output files generated by runs and triage.

## Why this folder exists

The project promise is a clean, reproducible evidence packet. This module ensures every run emits a predictable bundle layout and file contracts.

## Expected outputs

- `run.json` for run metadata.
- `metrics.csv` for plotting and spreadsheet workflows.
- `metrics.json` for machine parsing by agent logic.
- Diff/report files against baseline.
- Structured bundle directories ready to share with engineers.

## Current contents

- `run_writer.hpp/.cpp`: writes canonical `run.json` files into an output
  directory (`--out <dir>` from CLI) and ensures directory creation.
- `metrics_writer.hpp/.cpp`: writes canonical metrics artifacts:
  - `metrics.csv` for plotting and spreadsheet workflows
  - `metrics.json` for machine parsing by agent logic

## Design principle

Artifact structure should be stable and easy to parse by both humans and automation.

## Connection to the project

Without reliable artifact contracts, isolated findings cannot be handed off efficiently. This folder is the bridge between test execution and actionable engineering evidence.
