# docs

Project documentation for operators, developers, and reviewers.

## Why this folder exists

The codebase needs companion documentation for workflows, bundle contracts, playbooks, and release checks. Keeping docs centralized improves onboarding and reduces tribal knowledge.

## Expected contents

- Architecture and operating docs.
- Triage bundle contract (`triage_bundle_spec.md`).
- Scenario schema contract (`scenario_schema.md`).
- Release/readiness verification guidance.
- Incident and troubleshooting playbooks.

## Connection to the project

Good documentation ensures LabOps outputs are understandable and actionable across hardware, software, QA, and operations teams.
