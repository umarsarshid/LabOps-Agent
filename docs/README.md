# docs

Project documentation for operators, developers, and reviewers.

## Why this folder exists

The codebase needs companion documentation for workflows, bundle contracts, playbooks, and release checks. Keeping docs centralized improves onboarding and reduces tribal knowledge.

## Expected contents

- Architecture and operating docs.
- Triage bundle contract (`triage_bundle_spec.md`).
- Scenario schema contract (`scenario_schema.md`).
- Release verification checklist (`release_verification.md`).
- Real-backend local setup/safety guide (`real_backend_setup.md`).
- Real-backend troubleshooting playbook (`real_backend_troubleshooting.md`).
- Non-functional refactor roadmap (`code_smartness_levelup.md`).
- Release/readiness verification guidance.
- Incident and troubleshooting playbooks.
- Integration implementation guides (for example real SDK backend onboarding).

## Connection to the project

Good documentation ensures LabOps outputs are understandable and actionable across hardware, software, QA, and operations teams.
