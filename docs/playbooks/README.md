# docs/playbooks

Operational playbooks for recurring triage and response workflows.

## Why this folder exists

When failures recur, teams should follow a known decision path rather than reinventing investigation steps. Playbooks turn best practices into repeatable procedures.

## Expected contents

- Symptom-based triage checklists.
- Escalation criteria and ownership handoff.
- Recovery steps and verification criteria.
- Links to required artifacts for each incident type.

## Connection to the project

Playbooks close the loop between automated evidence generation and practical human response during debugging and production incidents.
